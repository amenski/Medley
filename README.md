> A tag-based note taking app using Markdown for formatting.

## Features

- Plain markdown editor
- Preview mode
- Tag based organization
- Slick interface

## Usage

### Create a Note

There are a few ways you can create a note:

- *File > New Note*
- `Ctrl/Cmd + N`
- The `+` button above the notes

You can add a tag right off the bat by entering the tag in the "New Note" prompt. (e.g. `School/Chemistry/Exam Notes`)

*Note:* If you have a tag selected, new notes will have that tag as well.

### Adding a Tag to a Note

To add a tag, follow these quick steps:

1. Open the "Details" pane (`...` or `Ctrl/Cmd + D`)
1. Enter a new tag in the "Add a tag" field (e.g. `School/Chemistry`)
1. Press `Enter`
